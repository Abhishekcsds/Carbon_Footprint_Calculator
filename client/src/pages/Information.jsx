          A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.

          The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.
